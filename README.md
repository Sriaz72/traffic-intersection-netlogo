# Traffic Intersection Simulation (NetLogo)

An agent-based simulation that models vehicle movement and traffic light control at a road intersection.

## Description
This project simulates cars moving through an intersection based on traffic light states. It helps visualize traffic flow and basic congestion scenarios.

## Features
- Traffic light control logic
- Vehicle movement using agents
- Basic traffic flow observation
